# Data Science Learning Tasks

Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

What I Learned: Discovered industry-specific applications that go beyond textbook examples.
Difficulties Faced: Finding unique and innovative use cases required extra research.
Final Thought: Exploring real-world scenarios gave me a broader perspective on data science.

Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

What I Learned: Creating a structured diagram helped clarify the relationships between AI, ML, and DL.
Difficulties Faced: Ensuring the diagram was both simple and informative was challenging.
Final Thought: Visual representations make complex concepts easier to understand and remember.

Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

What I Learned: Realized that data science is a mix of technical expertise and business understanding.
Difficulties Faced: Differentiating between overlapping roles like Data Scientist and Data Engineer was tricky.
Final Thought: Strong communication skills are just as important as technical proficiency in data science.

Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

What I Learned: A well-defined lifecycle is essential for creating effective data-driven solutions.
Difficulties Faced: Understanding the fine line between preprocessing and feature engineering was challenging.
Final Thought: Following a structured approach improves problem-solving and decision-making
