**Review from a Student’s Perspective**

**Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm**
**What I Learned:**  
I explored various ways data science is applied across different industries, expanding my understanding beyond standard textbook examples. I found it particularly interesting how fields like sports analytics, agriculture, and cybersecurity leverage data science.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Thinking of unique applications that weren’t already discussed in class was challenging. I had to conduct additional research to understand how data science is utilized in specific scenarios.

**Final Thought:**  
This task encouraged me to think critically and explore practical, real-world uses of data science beyond traditional case studies.

**Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram**
**What I Learned:**  
I gained a clearer understanding of the hierarchical relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). Creating a diagram helped me visualize that ML is a subset of AI, and DL is a subset of ML.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Neatly organizing the diagram was a challenge. Additionally, simplifying the explanation without losing clarity required careful thought.

**Final Thought:**  
Visualizing concepts makes them easier to grasp, and I plan to incorporate diagrams more often in my studies.

**Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research**
**What I Learned:**  
I discovered that a Data Scientist’s responsibilities extend beyond just building models. Tasks like data cleaning, visualization, and business communication are equally important. Additionally, not all roles in data science require extensive coding.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Distinguishing between similar roles, such as Data Scientist and Data Engineer, was difficult. Writing concise yet informative descriptions also posed a challenge.

**Final Thought:**  
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that requires both technical and analytical skills to solve real-world problems.

**Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example**
**What I Learned:**  
The Data Science process follows a structured lifecycle, from problem identification to deployment. I also learned that model evaluation and continuous improvement are critical stages in the process.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Breaking down a real-world application into each lifecycle step was tricky. Differentiating between data preprocessing and feature engineering was another challenge.

**Final Thought:**  
Understanding the complete data science workflow is crucial—it’s not just about building models but about managing the entire data pipeline effectively.

---

**Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion**
**What I Learned:**  
Ethical concerns in Data Science are significant, particularly in areas like AI bias, privacy, and accountability. Even well-developed models can have unintended consequences if not designed responsibly.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Choosing a single ethical issue to focus on was difficult since all of them are crucial. Maintaining a neutral perspective while discussing these concerns was another challenge.

**Final Thought:**  
AI and data science must be developed and used responsibly to prevent harm and ensure fairness.

---

**Bonus Task: Data Science Career Paths**
**What I Learned:**  
Data Science offers various career opportunities, ranging from technical roles like Machine Learning Engineer to more business-focused positions like Data Analyst. Data Engineering, though distinct, plays a crucial role in the field.

**Difficulties Faced:**  
Some job roles had overlapping responsibilities, making it difficult to distinguish them. Understanding how different companies define these roles added another layer of complexity.

**Final Thought:**  
The diversity of career paths in Data Science is exciting, and I need to explore which role best aligns with my interests and skills.
