# Review from an Average Student’s Perspective

## Task 1: Data Science Applications Brainstorm

### What I Learned:
- I discovered how data science is applied in different fields beyond what was covered in the learning materials.
- It was interesting to see how industries like sports analytics, agriculture, and cybersecurity use data science.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Coming up with unique applications that weren’t already mentioned in class was tough.
- I had to do extra research to understand how data science is specifically used in each application.

### Final Thought:
This task helped me think beyond textbook examples and explore real-world use cases.

## Task 2: AI, ML, DL Relationship Diagram

### What I Learned:
- I now understand how Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) are connected.
- Creating a diagram helped me visualize that ML is a subset of AI, and DL is a subset of ML.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Drawing the diagram neatly was a challenge.
- I had to simplify my explanation so it was clear and not overly technical.

### Final Thought:
Visualizing concepts makes them easier to understand. I’ll try using diagrams more in my studies.

## Task 3: Data Scientist Roles Research

### What I Learned:
- A Data Scientist does more than just build models. Data cleaning, visualization, and business communication are just as important.
- There are many roles within data science, and not all involve coding heavily.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Some roles, like Data Engineer vs. Data Scientist, seemed similar, and I had to carefully compare them.
- Writing concise yet detailed descriptions was a bit tricky.

### Final Thought:
Data Science is not just about coding—it’s also about understanding data and solving business problems.

## Task 4: Data Science Lifecycle Example

### What I Learned:
- Data Science follows a structured lifecycle from problem identification to deployment.
- Even after building a model, evaluation and improvement are crucial steps.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Applying the lifecycle to a real-world application was tough because I had to break it into each step.
- I wasn’t sure if I was explaining some steps correctly, like data preprocessing vs. feature engineering.

### Final Thought:
Data Science is more than just training models; understanding the entire workflow is important.

## Task 5: Data Science Ethics Discussion

### What I Learned:
- Ethics in Data Science is a real problem, and issues like bias in AI, privacy concerns, and accountability can have serious impacts.
- Even the best AI models can be unfair or harmful if not properly designed.

### Difficulties Faced:
- It was hard to pick one major ethical concern because they all seemed important.
- Explaining the issue in a balanced way (without sounding too biased) was challenging.

### Final Thought:
AI is powerful, but it must be used responsibly to avoid harming people.

## Bonus Task: Data Science Career Paths

### What I Learned:
- There are many career paths in Data Science, and some focus more on coding (ML Engineer) while others focus more on business insights (Data Analyst).
- Data Engineering is very important, but it’s different from a Data Scientist’s role.

### Difficulties Faced:
- Some career paths overlapped, and I had to clearly differentiate them.
- Finding the right job responsibilities was tricky since different companies define roles differently.

### Final Thought:
Data Science has many career options, and I need to figure out which path interests me the most.

## Overall Reflection as an Average Student

### What I Gained:
- A deeper understanding of real-world data science applications.
- A clearer idea of career options in Data Science.
- The importance of ethics in AI & ML.
- A structured way to approach problems using the data science lifecycle.

### Challenges Faced:
- Researching and summarizing information without copying from the internet.
- Explaining concepts in my own words while keeping them simple and clear.
- Making diagrams and structured explanations for better understanding.
