# Python OOP Concepts Overview
This repository showcases fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through a Jupyter notebook. It explores class creation, constructors, inheritance, multiple inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism using relatable examples like dogs, cats, puppies, hybrids, robots, and animals.


### Task 1: Class Creation (Dog Class)
What I Learned: Defining classes, adding attributes, and creating methods.
Difficulties: Understanding self and ensuring methods use instance attributes correctly.


### Task 2: Constructors
What I Learned: Using __init__ to initialize objects dynamically with custom values.
Difficulties: Managing multiple instances and verifying attribute assignment.


### Task 3: Inheritance (Puppy Class)
What I Learned: Extending a base class and adding new functionality.
Difficulties: Ensuring inherited methods work as expected without redefinition.


### Task 4: Multiple Inheritance (Hybrid Class)
What I Learned: Combining features from multiple parent classes.
Difficulties: Resolving method conflicts and understanding method resolution order (MRO).


### Task 5: Encapsulation (Robot Class)
What I Learned: Protecting data with private/protected attributes and using getters/setters.
Difficulties: Grasping naming conventions (e.g., __ vs _) and testing access restrictions.


### Task 6: Polymorphism (Animal Class)
What I Learned: Implementing the same method differently across subclasses for varied behavior.
Difficulties: Handling abstract-like behavior with NotImplementedError and designing a generic function.
